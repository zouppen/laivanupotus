# hBattleShip

A battleship game written in Haskell. Just written for fun with no
intention to publish anywhere except this repo.

Written as a cheat sheet for me in my future projects. Therefore a
multitude of things were used:

* hUnit for testing
* megaparsec for command line parsing
* monadic transformations
* State monad
* Some of my favourite language extensions

One future goal might be to implement a game as a Asterisk AGI
script. There is [a plan](puhelinpeli.md) (in Finnish).
